This will be my project for CS Projects

GHRBLinux will be developed in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

## Functions ##

* Take input from a wireless XInput guitar controller (Xbox 360)
    - This will be from the Wireless Xbox 360 Controller Adapter for PC (or similar products like mine)
* Take input from a wired ION Drum Rocker for the WII
* Give the computer gamepad instructions for said controllers

## Use ##

* This will be used for me to be able to play [Clone Hero](https://www.clonehero.net) on my linux laptop with my controllers, making sure everything works properly
* I do not know if things worked prior, but I want to make sure my controllers work perfectly in linux
